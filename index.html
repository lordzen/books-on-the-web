<section id="abstract">
  <p>
  This document introduces a user-focused vision of books as first-class
  citizens of the Web—with off-Web reading systems (beyond normal Web user
  agents) made superfluous, and
  “<a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>portable web publications</a>”
  made irrelevant.
  <p>
  This vision assumes no user desire for “portability” of books, nor user
  desire to ever be required to “switch” into off-Web reading of electronic
  books, nor user desire for “convergence” of the reading experience of
  books on the Web with that of legacy reading systems. Instead, this
  document starts by reminding all that the fundamental quality of the Web,
  consciously designed into it by its creator from its very creation, is
  <i>Universality</i>.
  <p>
  This document outlines how to draw on that fundamental quality of
  Universality designed into the Web’s soul to build a user-first
  reading experience for books on the Web based the principle of the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">Priority of Constituencies</a>,
  always putting the needs of users first—above the needs of any other
  constituency.
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
  <p>This document outlines a general vision and should not be considered a
technical specification. Instead, its goal is to outline that vision and
the possible technical directions to achieve it; more detailed technical
work should be documented in separate documents.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="introduction">Our Vision</h2>

  <p class="vision">Our vision for <a>Portable Web Publications</a> is to define a class of documents on the Web that would be part of the Digital Publishing ecosystem but would also be fully native citizens of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>.  In this vision, the current format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable and online (Web) document publishing is diminished to zero. These are merely two dynamic manifestations of the same publication: content authored with online use as the primary mode can easily be saved by the user for offline reading in portable document form. Content authored primarily for use as a portable document can be put online, without any need for refactoring the content. Publishers can choose to utilize either or both of these publishing modes, and users can choose either or both of these consumption modes. Essential features flow seamlessly between online and offline modes; examples include cross-references, user annotations, access to online databases, as well as licensing and rights management.
  </p>

  <p>The precise definition of <a>Portable Web Publications</a> is provided in the section <a href='#pwp_definition'></a>. For the sake of this introduction, suffices to say that a <a>Portable Web Publication</a> is a collection of content items (e.g. pages, chapters, modules, articles) whose content is compatible with Web usage, and structured as a single, self-contained logical unit. Individual items can consist of text, images, graphics, possibly interactive mathematical or chemical formulae, as well as audio and video. These documents, by definition, have a default, linear “reading order”, however the user may choose to skip around in the content just as with a book on paper; alternatively, interactive aspects of the content may alter the reading order on behalf of the user.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="whynow">Why work on this now?</h2>
  <p>Digital Publishing can be considered to be at a tipping point. Digital publishing formats like EPUB have been broadly adopted globally for trade ebooks, and are starting to gain adoption among textbook publishers as well as corporate marketing departments. However, these formats have largely been seen as “offline” formats up until now. Various browser extensions supporting such complex publications exist, and other solutions are available for delivering these publications in browsers. Browser- and cloud-based solutions require relatively complex server and/or client software. In many cases browser- and cloud-based solutions depend on a proprietary transformation of the packaged files into formats more suitable to network delivery. A focused effort to make digital publications first-class Open Web Platform citizens will result in a significant reduction in the complexity of deploying publishing content into browsers for both online and offline consumption. Further, this focused effort will increase the momentum of digital publication and associated Web adoption across communities who are looking for an open, non-proprietary, next-generation portable document format.</p>

  <p>The broader Web Platform can also be considered to be at a tipping point. Mobile platform web site use is diminishing in favor of native applications. Hybrid applications that use web content alongside native application technology, and web-technology-based system applications are growing. The specific means of delivering hybrid and web-technology-based system applications is currently proprietary to specific applications frameworks and/or browser platforms. The point of Portable Web Publications is to increase problem solving momentum in package, metadata, and offline support applicable to both portable publications and installed applications. Open and native solutions to replace proprietary packaging, metadata, and offline support are intended to ensure the broadest possible general adoption of the Open Web Platform.
  </p>

  <p>In many respects, the convergence is already happening. In a number of areas (e.g., educational publications, travel books, etc.) publishers already exploit the advanced possibilities of packaged publishing formats to produce highly interactive documents whose features are very close to what one is used to on the Web (see the separate section <a href="#epub-relations"></a> for some examples). And the converse is also true: tutorial and introductory articles have appeared on the Web that have the quality of traditional publications that one was used to seeing in a scientific magazine, but combined with the interactive possibilities of the Web (<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike Bostock’s article on visualizing algorithms</a> or <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Bret Victor’s article on visualization</a> are just two of several possible examples). However, the convergence still has a long way to go, and this is the topic that this document, and the concept of <a>Portable Web Publications</a>, aim to explore.

  <h2>What are the areas of interest?</h2>

  <p>A principled approach to making books first-class citizens of the Web
  involves addressing the needs of the following stakeholders:

  <section>
    <h3>Users</h3>
    <p>The right approach to making the best possible user experience
    for books on the Web starts simply by meeting the needs of users first,
    beyond all other needs. The needs of other constituencies will
    naturally be addressed by meeting user needs (at least for other
    constituencies that are actually acting in good faith to meet user needs,
    instead of acting in practice against the best interests of users).

    <p>In contrast to the vision presented in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
    this document starts from a realization that users in fact do no want
    to be ushered (however subtly) into having to make choices among
    different reading systems for the same content, depending on the
    particular reading contexts they find themselves in. Users instead want
    a truly <i>universal</i> system for reading. Users want the Web.

    <p>Before 2008 or so, when smartphones and tablets capable of running full
    Web browsers with full access to the Web began to become prevalent,
    there was some value to users in having specialized off-Web devices with
    specialized reading systems. But for years now, users have actually had
    smartphones and tablets with full Web capabilities—so there is no longer any
    user need or desire for such specialized off-Web devices, nor for such
    legacy off-Web specialized reading systems.

    <p>Even in the case where, say, roaming charges are often high, or when
    internet access may be of low quality or not available at all, the Web
    itself—through
    <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>—provides
    users with the possibility to automatically have, in an easy manner,
    offline access at any time, anywhere, to any Web publication they are reading.

    <p>So the best possible user experience can now be provided to readers
    just through the power of the Web. A truly universal reading experience.

    <section>
    <h4>Secondary constituencies</h4>

    <p>Secondary constituencies who can help give readers the best possible user
    experience of books on the Web:
    <dl>
      <dt>Publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Book publishers are investing in the development of technical
      expertise in web technologies. While gaining understanding of technical
      topics is important to new and future publishing workflows, the lack of
      communication between the trade publishers and web-application developer
      communities is resulting in unnecessary duplication and investments in
      effort.</p>

      <p>Collaboration between the Web content development and publishing
      communities will result in major benefits to publishers. Moving to
      a truly user-first model of books on the Web that takes full advantage
      of the universality of the Web means publishers can concentrate on
      engaging content authors in the production of high quality content.

      <p>The web-content development community can be relied on to deal
      with sophisticated technical issues (e.g., CSS, SVG). Potential
      future web content formats (e.g., 3D rendering) and various
      interactive web programs (e.g., visualization tools like <a
      href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>) will naturally flow into the publishing
      realm by moving to a user-first model of books on the Web, hence
      increasing publishers’ opportunities to sell new content products
      across the board.</p>

      <p>Realizing new opportunities is a reality for publishers
      traditionally considered to be on the leading edge of technological
      advances in working with content. These publishers include
      <a href="#schol"><abbr title="Science, Technology, and
      Medical">STM</abbr> and educational publishing houses, as well as scholarly
      and journal publishing organizations</a>.</p>

      <p>A user-first model of books on the Web will support more tools and
      services and a much larger population of trained practitioners
      compared to the current state of working in parallel universes.</p>

      <dt id=schol>Scholarly journal and <abbr title="Science, Technology, and Medical">STM</abbr> publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Scholarly journal publishers also provide articles for download
      these days. The most popular distribution format for journal articles
      continues to be PDF—as a direct reflection of the scholarly community,
      which highly prioritizes linear text and preservation of print typography.
      Indeed, the original goal for scholarly publishers to make files available
      online was to enable readers to download and print content directly,
      instead of borrowing a paper copy of a journal issue and photocopying
      relevant articles.</p>

      <p>But things are changing. First of all, Web-only publications
      become part of the mainstream (e.g., the multidisciplinary <a
      href="http://www.plosone.org">PLOS ONE</a> or the new <a
      href="https://peerj.com/computer-science/">PeerJ CompSci</a> journals) with
      the main content being published using traditional Web technologies like
      HTML and CSS. And there is much more. Scholarly communication increasingly
      uses additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, or very
      large images, and the trend is to consider these as integral parts of the
      scientific output. (<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike
      Bostock’s recent article on visualizing algorithms</a> or the “live”
      presentation of data in a <a
      href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-176/v1#f3">paper published by
      F1000 Research</a> are good examples for the new possibilities.)
      <p>
      Furthermore, publishing the scientific <em>data sources</em>, like the
      results of, say,  a sociological survey or measurement output of biochemical
      experiments alongside the “main” publication, is
      also coming to the fore, with some journals and institutions actually
      requiring public access to those. Gaining truly universal access to all
      these various media and contents is important for scholars—in order
      for them to be able to read articles at any time, anywhere, without
      ever being forced into using off-Web reading systems.
      <p>
      And tools such as peer-review systems and bibliographic management systems
      like
      <a href="http://www.mendelay.com">Mendeley</a> or
      <a href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a>, to
      the degree they don’t yet handle 100% Web-based publications, will
      necessarily evolve to support them—in order to better meet the needs of
      scholars, and to provide the best possible user experience for scholars.

      <p>And as those tools evolve to actually put the needs of their scholarly
      users first, any requirement for authors to be forced to try to duplicate
      Web publications into redundant offline versions of the same
      content—in order to compensate for deficiencies and short-sightedness in
      the user model—will disappear.

      <p>And with the advent of
      <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>,
      things like user annotations, formal reviews, etc., can be performed
      by the scholar online or offline directly in Web applications running in a
      normal mobile browser on small, mobile devices—with no need for a separate
      redundant off-Web version of a publication, and so no need to ever be
      forced to have to synchronize the Web publication with any off-Web version.

      <p>The transformative effects of moving to a Web-first model that truly
      places the needs of users above all else will fundamentally change
      the way scholarly publishing works—for the better.

      <dt id=in-house-publishers>In-house publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>A special form of document production is related to technical
      and/or user documentation of complex products as well as complex
      administrative documents. Such documents are often akin to STM or scholarly
      publications edited by traditional trade or scholarly publishers—but,
      often, the sheer quantity and complexity of production, as well as
      confidentiality requirements, mean that the production are done in-house.
      In many respects major corporations such as IBM, Intel, Renault, or Boeing,
      or institutions like the European Commission, the FAO, or the UNESCO have
      become specialized publishers themselves.</p>

      <p>The quantity of such documentation makes it infeasible to produce these
      documents in print (or print-only); instead, Web-publishing them is
      the optimal way to provide the best possible user experience for them.

      <p>Just as for scientific publications, moving to a user-first model of
      books on the Web will provide new possibilities for these types of
      in-house publications. Using
      <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>,
      a Web publication can be made fully usable even when offline—in, for
      example, an airplane cockpit.

      <dt>Libraries and archival services</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>The archiving of digital assets is coming to the fore as a
      significant issue for dedicated institutions like national libraries. With
      the arrival of highly dynamic and possibly interactive Web publications as
      primary content, the traditional means of archiving (i.e., storing on some
      backup device for long term preservation) is no longer adequate.
      Web publications depend on a multitude of auxiliary files, like CSS
      stylesheets, images, videos, JavaScript programs, etc. The good news is
      that the Web itself already provides the means for archiving such
      publications, and there will be large growth in business opportunities
      for developers of systems that cater to this need well.

      <dt id=financial-reporting>Financial reporting</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>The domain of financial reporting is increasingly making use of
      dynamic and interactive content for reports published on the Web—but in
      order to meet legal, audit, and market requirements, it is important to be
      able to identify a specific, unchanging version of the document, including
      all auxiliary files it references.</p>

      <p>For example, financial reports must often be submitted to tax
      authorities, company registrars, stock exchanges, securities regulators,
      and other institutions, and it is critical to be able to identify the
      specific version that was filed, and to ensure that the document is not
      subsequently altered, including through changes to any external files that
      it references. Similarly, an auditor will give an opinion on a financial
      document, and it is important to be able to identify the exact version that
      was audited. These documents should be universally available in a
      common location for all parties to access, while still enabling
      confidentiality of the information among the parties.

      <p>The Web itself provides the means for both universally and
      confidentially serving snapshot versions of such reports to all
      authenticated users who need access to them. And in contrast to off-Web
      packaged
      <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>portable web publications</a>,
      the Web itself—through standard Web features such as TLS
      (HTTPS) and
      <a href=https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/>Subresource Integrity</a>—provides
      for any user to fully and independently verify the provenance and
      integrity (against any tampering in transit) of any Web-published
      report—including the integrity of all auxiliary files it references; that
      is, the Web provides robust digital signing and non-repudiation mechanisms
      for such reports.

<section id="terminology">
  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>This document is based on the following definitions.</p>

  <section id="core_definition">
    <h2>Books on the Web</h2>

    <ul class="definition">
      <li>
      <p>The term
      <dfn data-lt="books on the Web|book on the Web">Books on the Web</dfn>
      itself is chosen to convey, in the clearest and simplest possible
      way, that a Web book is simply just a website, or a subdirectory or
      path within a website, with a Web URL from which the book is made
      available to readers—a URL that can be passed around (for example,
      sent to others via e-mail) and that forms a universal address for the
      book for potential access by anyone, anywhere.

      <p>
      And the term <i>book</i> is used here in part just as shorthand
      for any <a>Web publication</a>—a <a href=#schol>scholarly journal</a>, or an
      <a href=#in-house-publishers>in-house publication</a>, or a
      <a href=#financial-reporting>financial report</a>, or whatever other
      class of document published on the Web.

      <p>
      That said, books as a class are called out in this term
      because in practice currently, the user experience around reading
      books is often, in suboptimal ways, different from the user
      experience of reading other classes of online publications—for
      example, online newspapers.

      <p>
      The difference with books in practice is that book
      readers are ushered into reading books in specialized off-Web reading
      systems that do not participate in the richness of the full feature
      set of the Web and so that do not provide users with the full
      advantages of the Web and the best user experience possible.

      <p>
      But there is no reason in principle why reading a book should
      ever require a user to need an off-Web reading system—any more than
      reading a newspaper should require a user to need an off-Web reading
      system. So the term <i>books on the Web</i> is meant to convey the
      lack of any need for a packaging mechanism like the one on which
      the vision in
      <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
      is premised.

      <p>
      If specialized reading systems are made superfluous, then there is no
      need for a “portable” package format for Web publications; instead, books
      and other publications can be universally accessed as 100% true
      <a>Web publications</a>—that is, just as <i>books on the Web</i>.

      <li>A <dfn data-lt="Web Publication|Web Publications|Web publications">Web Publication</dfn>
      is a <a>Web Resource</a> which itself is an aggregated set of
      interrelated <a>Web Resources</a>, and which is intended to be considered
      as a single <a>Web Resource</a>. Furthermore:
        <ul>
          <li>As a <a>Web Resource</a>, a <a>Web Publication</a> has its
          own URL which refers to the <em>full set</em> of the constituent resources
          (as opposed to a particular <a>Web Resource</a> <em>within</em> the <a>Web
          Publication</a>).</li>

          <li>A <a>Web Publication</a> must be constructed of resources
          whose formats enable (individually or in conjunction with other resources
          in the same <a>Web Publication</a>) delivery of <a>essential content</a>
          and <a>functionality</a> based on standard technologies of the

      can be verified using Web features such as
      <a href=https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/>Subresource Integrity</a>,
      etc.

  <section id="state_definition">
    <h3>States of a Portable Web Publication</h3>

    <p>The states of a <a>Portable Web Publication</a> can be separated into two different axes. These different states require a different behavior from the user agent, while some of the characteristics of the publication may be invariant across states. The different states are as follows:</p>

    <ol class="definition">
      <li><strong>States related to the organization of the <a>Web Resources</a></strong>: A <a>Portable Web Publication</a> is in
        <ul>
          <li><dfn data-lt="packed|Packed|packed state|Packed State">Packed State</dfn>: when all constituents <a>Web Resources</a> are combined into one unit for storage in a file system, network transfer, etc.</li>
          <li><dfn data-lt="unpacked|Unpacked|unpacked state|Unpacked State">Unpacked State</dfn>: when all constituent <a>Web Resources</a> can be directly accessed individually through standard network protocols like HTTP, FTP, etc., or through file system access</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>States related to the access of <a>Web Resources</a></strong>: A <a>Portable Web Publication</a> is in
        <ul>
          <li><dfn data-lt="protocol|Protocol|protocol state|Protocol State">Protocol State</dfn>: when all constituent <a>Web Resources</a>, as well as the <a>Portable Web Publication</a> itself, are accessed through network protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP</li>
          <li><dfn data-lt="file|File|file state|File State">File State</dfn>: when all constituent <a>Web Resources</a>, as well as the <a>Portable Web Publication</a> itself, are accessed as files on a local file system</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The table below shows the same publication (PWP) in the most typical states:</p>

    <table class="zebra">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Protocol</th>
          <th>File</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Packed</th>
          <td>PWP as one archive file on a Web Server</td>
          <td>PWP as one archive file on a local disc</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Unpacked</th>
          <td>PWP spread over several files on a Web Server</td>
          <td>PWP spread over several files on a local disc</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="note">The difference between <a>protocol</a> and <a>file</a> states is not identical, although close, to the difference between the commonly used notions of “online” vs. “offline”. A PWP can be on a local disc but accessed through a Web Server running on that machine (i.e., through a <code>http://localhost</code> URL): the PWP is in a <a>protocol</a> state, though clearly “offline”. Similarly, a remote file system can be mounted as a local disc, in which case a PWP can be accessed as a file, i.e., is in a <a>file</a> state, though possibly “online”. </p>

  <h2>Achieving convergence: work areas</h2>

  <p>This section lists some of the work areas that activities around <a>Portable Web Publications</a> should engage in. The list is not exhaustive and there are only hints at the technical solutions; one of the main goals of the work ahead will be to clarify the requirements and technical details. It must be emphasized that the solutions to these problems may not come exclusively from W3C, but possibly from other, external organizations (document identification is a typical example).</p>

  <section id="arch">
    <h3>General Architecture for Portable Web Publications</h3>

    <p id="sworkers">The latest evolution of browser technologies around Web Workers[[web-workers]] and Service Workers[[service-workers]] may fundamentally change the way browsers operate in terms of offline/online. Service Workers will provide a flexible and programmable way to efficiently implement local caching of <a>Web Resources</a>. Caching is implemented as a programmable network proxy, meaning that the browser’s rendering engine becomes oblivious to whether a resource originates from the local cache or directly from the network. </p>

    <p>This evolution makes it possible to bring <a>Portable Web Publications</a> under the same abstraction as a <a>Web Resource</a> identified by a URL. A specialized service worker can cache resources, i.e., can bridge the differences between the offline and online access of a document. Furthermore, by adding additional functionalities to the service worker, it can also deal with possible (un)packaging as well as bridging the differences between <a>protocol</a> and <a>file</a> states. In other words, the core rendering engine of a user agent can operate <strong>as if the <a>Portable Web Publication</a> was in <a>unpacked</a> and <a>protocol</a> states, with all resources available</strong>; the differences are handled by the service worker acting as a proxy.</p>

    </figure>

    <p class="note">This architecture needs some special care when handling a <a>Portable Web Publication</a> on a local file system. This is because Service Workers operate using the <code>HTTPS</code> (or <code>HTTP</code> for <code>localhost</code>) protocol only, i.e., the <code>file:///</code> protocol is not understood. A possible approach, already implemented in some experimental code, is to start up a local HTTP server serving the resources within the <a>Web Publication</a>. See also <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpub-pwp/issues/11">Issue 11</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="package">
    <h4>Archive formats</h4>

    <p>Regardless of the details of the practical architecture realizing <a>Portable Web Publications</a>, an archive format is necessary for the storage of a publication as one file (e.g., for distribution or possibly archiving) defined as the <a>packed</a> state of a <a>Portable Web Publication</a>. A variety of formats for offline/archival storage of collections of digital resources exist today [[OCF]], [[ODF]], [[OOXML]], but none of them is universally recognized and supported across all ecosystems. Depending on the general architecture, <a>Portable Web Publications</a> may use one of the deployed formats (e.g., the current EPUB packaging format based on [[OCF]]), or an archive format that is generic and native to the Open Web Platform. </p>

    <p>W3C’s <a href="http://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft for a Streamable Package Format for the Web[[web-packaging]] to encompass the needs of various applications (like installing Web Applications or downloading data for local processing). It is not clear at this moment whether browsers will adopt this format, though. </p>

    <p>However, the importance of streaming is not paramount for <a>Portable Web Publications</a>. Indeed, the same publication may be accessed by the same user from different clients; if some user-dependent management also keeps track of the latest reading position in the publication, switching from one client to the other may mean that a client would have to “jump” <em>into</em> the content, thereby bypassing streaming. Nevertheless, if browsers, eventually, do converge towards a browser and streaming friendly packaging format, adopting it for <a>Portable Web Publications</a> may become a real alternative. The community will have to balance native browser availability against the the wide availibility of tooling and industry distribution based on [[OCF]].</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>The IETF has published an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-seantek-kerwin-arcmedia-type-01">informational draft on a top-level media type for archives</a>. Although that draft does not specify a specific archive format, and the work is currently on hold, it shows the overall interest in packaging on the Web in line with the concerns of <a>Portable Web Publications</a>.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="manifest">
    <h3>Publication Manifests</h3>

    <p>The <dfn>manifest</dfn> of <a>Portable Web Publications</a> is a <a>Web Resource</a> that includes information pertaining to the overall publication structure, such as the default logical reading order(s) of the set of resources that comprise the publication (the “spine”), as well as predictable user-facing meta-structures, such as one or several tables of contents, glossaries, etc. As described in the separate section <a href="#identification"></a> that overall structural information may be what a client would return on a request for a <a>Portable Web Publication</a> instance, as an abstraction for a collection of <a>Web Resources</a>. For <a>Portable Web Publications</a> it may be imperative to optimize these data structures in a way that is native to the Open Web Platform and more easily supported in authoring tools, browsers, and Reading Systems. </p>

    <p class="note">The Manifest for web application format[[web-manifest]], currently developed at W3C, is one example of a technology that could potentially be used, or adopted, to achieve this goal. Note, however, that the [[web-manifest]] specification is (currently) geared towards Web Applications, which may not make it suitable for direct adoption for <a>Portable Web Publications</a>; hence the possible needs of adoption rather than using it directly.</p>

    <p class="note">Whilst these information objects are important for larger and/or more complex publications, it is unnecessary for other use cases of <a>Portable Web Publications</a>. A typical example is the archival of a single Web page with all the necessary style sheets, images, and similar resources. The definition for <a>Portable Web Publications</a> should therefore include the definition of a set of “defaults”, i.e., it should not require the presence of, say, a spine if the publication contains one single HTML file.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="identification">
    <h3>Addressing and Identification</h3>

    <p>HTTP(S) URLs serve as the fundamental method for addressing a resource, or a fragment thereof, on the Web. Such URLs can also be used to uniquely <em>identify</em> a resource; however, conceptually, the role of addressing and identification are different. <em>Both</em> of these functionalities should be available for <a>Portable Web Publications</a>: a publication should be uniquely identified for, e.g., library catalogues or archival, and a resource locator should be available so that the user could access the content. In other words, a <a>Web Publication</a> (whether portable or not) SHOULD have both one or even possibly several <em>identifier(s)</em> and one <em>locator</em>. These may be be identical but may also be different: e.g., an identifier may refer to a specific publication by a publisher (e.g., using an <a href="https://www.isbn-international.org/">ISBN</a>), whereas the locator may refer to a personal copy of that publication that the owner can freely annotate for personal use.</p>

    <p class="note">A typical, and extremely important use case for the presense of an <em>identifier</em> beyond the need for a <em>locator</em> is in academic and scholarly publishing. There are currently several methods for citing online works, but there is no equivalent standard method for citations to ebooks. Even if a reflowable ebook is by a scholar, the author must refer to PDF, paper copy, or HTML version to cite it in her bibliography. Identifiers attached to <a>Portable Web Publications</a> should enable stable citations.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>A general [[URI]] (which includes the notion of [[URL]]) can serve as an <em>identifier</em> using, e.g., the [[ISBN-URN]] or [[UUID]] schemes. In other words, an identifier does not necessarily resolves to a location on the Web, although it is a good practice to have a dereferencable identifier.</p>

      <p> There is no  ubiquitously accepted method for identifying a publication among the various document formats (whether electronic or printed). Within the scholarly publishing industry, for example, initiatives such as <a href="http://www.doi.org">DOI</a> and <a href="http://crossref.org">CROSSREF</a> have addressed this problem, whereas traditional “trade” publishing rely more on <a href="https://www.isbn-international.org/">ISBN</a> related services. Some of these identifier schemes provide resolver services or a “standard” representation in term of [[URL]]. The definition of <a>Portable Web Publication</a> should be oblivious to the exact identification used; this issue is left to specialized services and industry organizations. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue" data-number="12">Do we need a more general form of identification to represent scopes?</div>

    <p>For the purpose of the general architecture of <a>Portable Web Publications</a> this document concentrates on <em>locators</em>; as far as identifiers are concerned, the only important point is that such identifier SHOULD also exist and made available, and that they should be stable across, for example, copying the publication or changing its location on the Web. Also, based on the discussion in <a href="#arch"></a>, only the <a>unpacked</a> and <a>protocol</a> states of <a>Portable Web Publications</a> are discussed.</p>

    <p>There are a number of different aspects of addressing that should be specified for a <a>Portable Web Publication</a>. Some of these are follows:</p>

    <section>
      <h4>What should be the response of an HTTP(S)&nbsp;GET request?</h4>
      <p>Conceptually, it should be the <a>manifest</a> of the publication which, in fact, “represents” the <a>Web Publication</a> as a whole. In practice, this means providing access to the corresponding manifest file through either:</p>

      <ul class="definition">
        <li>returning the <a>manifest</a> itself; or</li>
        <li>returning another content (e.g., the first chapter in the document) but providing a link to the <a>manifest</a> through a <code>LINK:</code> in the HTTP response header; or</li>
        <li>returning and HTML content (e.g., the first chapter in the document) but providing a link to the <a>manifest</a> through a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These possibilities are not mutually exclusive.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>What is the URL for one of the resources <em>within</em> a <a>Portable Web Publication</a>?</h4>

      <p>I.e.: if the <code>http://www.ex.org/doc.pwp</code> locator refers to the <a>Portable Web Publication</a> as a whole, what is the URL for one of its constituent resources, e.g., <code>chapter1.html</code>?</p>

      <p>The simplest approach is to consider the URL of the <a>Web Publication</a> as the base for all relative URL-s, meaning that the location of the constituents are of the form: <code>http://www.ex.org/doc.pwp/chapter1.html</code> where <code>http://www.ex.org/</code> is the URL of the the <a>Web Publication</a> itself. In other words, the locator of the <a>Web Publication</a> sets the “context”.</p>

      <p>This simple approach works well if the <a>Web Publication</a> is created from bottom up; however, it does rely on a particular organization of the resources. The scheme does not work if the <a>Web Publication</a> (which is defined to be a set of <a>Web Resources</a>) includes resources at many different places on the Web. This issue may be mitigated by adding mappings (“virtual redirections”) of URLs in the <a>manifest</a> of the <a>Web Publication</a>.</p>

      <p class="note">When using the virtual redirections a particular constituent <a>Web Resource</a> may end up having two URL-s: one is its intrinsic URL as a resource on the Web, the other via the URL of the <a>Web Publication</a>.</p>

      <p class="note">Another alternative that is used in practice is to use an explicit separator between the URL for the publication and the rest, yielding, e.g., <code>http://www.ex.org/doc.pwp!chapter1.html</code>. It is not clear what advantages this approach would have.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>How does one locate the internal content of a particular constituent resource?</h4>
        <p>The definition of <a>Web Publications</a> should not include any new mechanism at this point; they should rather entirely rely on fragment identifiers as defined and widely used on the Web.</p>

        <p class="note">As examples for the power of fragment identifiers, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/annotation/">W3C Annotation Working Group</a> has a joint deliverable with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">W3C Web Platform Working Group</a> called [[FindText]]. Although the specification aims at a programmable API, it may also provide a general framework of identifying specific textual content within, e.g., and HTML file through the definion of a fragment identifier. Similarly, the W3C Media Fragments specification[[media-frags]] may prove useful to address some of the use cases. </p>
    </section>
   </section>

  <section id="metadata">
    <h3>Metadata: discovery</h3>
    <p>Throughout the digital publishing industry, highly specialized metadata vocabularies, and serialization forms thereof, are being used. Within book trade publishing as an example, ONIX[[ONIX]] has attained a dominant status as a metadata package that typically exists (in XML form) independently of the publication, and contains not only bibliographic metadata, but also trade information such as pricing. Scholarly publishing, on the other hand, often uses various derivatives of the ubiquitous BibTeX vocabulary.</p>

    <p>While not contradicting the obvious use cases for out-of-line metadata records as used by publishers, retailers and libraries, <a>Portable Web Publications</a> must define a syntax for basic in-line metadata records that is agnostic to the publication’s states. This means that the syntax must seamlessly support discovery and harvesting by both generic Web search engines, as well as dedicated bibliographic/archival/retailer systems. While it is expected that <a>Portable Web Publications</a> will define a minimal set of required metadata (cf. the section <a href="#identification"></a>), development and adoption of other vocabularies in <a>Portable Web Publications</a> will most likely be deemed as out of scope. In other words, domain-specific metadata requirements are up to the domains themselves to define via a profiling mechanism, or similar yet-to-be-defined means. </p>

    <p class="note">The adoption of HTML as the vehicle for expressing publication-level metadata (i.e., using RDFa[[html-rdfa]] and/or Microdata[[microdata]] for metadata, like authors or title) would have the added benefits of better I18N support than XML or JSON formats.</p>

    <h3>Styling and Layout, Pagination</h3>
    <p>As outlined in [[dpub-latinreq]] or [[dpub-css-priorities]], the Open Web Platform in general, and CSS in particular, is still lacking solutions for meeting all of the publishers’ expectations on satisfactory typography and layout for digital publications. While improved presentation fidelity will be of paramount importance to the overall success and adoption rate of <a>Portable Web Publications</a>, it is clear that many of these issues are going to be addressed on a case-by-case basis by the CSS Working Group over a longer period of time. STM publishing, for example, where the faithful representation and rendering of, say, mathematical or chemical formulae is of a paramount importance, has particularly severe requirements that must be fulfilled by the Open Web Platform technologies. Similarly, dynamic pagination of reflowable content is not natively supported by browsers today, and as a result Reading System developers, for example, are forced to implement pagination using various ad-hoc approaches, all coming with a significant penalty in terms of development costs, performance and stability.</p>

    <p>It is anticipated that native support for pagination (in CSS and/or in the DOM) is going to be put forward by stakeholders as a critical component of <a>Portable Web Publications</a>; thus the finalization of <a>Portable Web Publications</a> may be contingent on the availability of a native pagination model for Web content.</p>

    <p class="note">Note that the <a href="https://wiki.css-houdini.org/">“Houdini” Task Force</a>, recently started jointly by the W3C CSS WG and the W3C TAG, may open new avenues to handle pagination.</p>

    <h3>Security Models</h3>

    <p>The security model of the Web, based primarily on the same-origin policy and the concept of “site”, does not apply to portable documents, as the notion of “origin” is based on HTTP properties that are invalidated/non-existent when a document transitions from its online state to the portable state. Portable Web Publications must incorporate a state agnostic security model that defines rules for both the online and portable states.</p>

    <h3>Presentation Control and Personalization</h3>

    <p>When reading long-form (and sometimes mission-critical) publications, personalization—i.e., the ability for users to adapt the presentation to suit their needs—is of a great importance. While technologies such as CSS Media Queries have come a long way in terms of adapting content to devices, this is not the same thing as adapting to a user. Presentation control features are often available in e-book readers of different kinds, for example the possibility to dynamically change font size or background/foreground color schemes, but implementations are brittle and limited due to the lack of an underlying framework that explicitly supports user adaptation.</p>

    <p><a>Portable Web Publications</a> needs to incorporate an explicit framework for achieving advanced and predictable user-triggered presentation control. (Note that from this perspective, accessibility can be seen just a radical case of personalization.)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Models for embracing domain-specific restrictions and extensions</h3>

    <p>Different domains of digital publishing have vastly different expectations and/or requirements on the nature of the content and their presentation. In the digital comics domain for example, the default presentation form is, traditionally at least, pre-paginated, fixed-form, and image-based, possibly with a set of omnipresent (i.e., cross-publisher) user interaction patterns that are expected to be enabled. On the other hand, for trade publishing the default form is fully reflowable content, where user interaction patterns are defined entirely by the user agent. In educational publishing, the ability to control structure, to include rich domain-specific structural semantics and extensive specialized metadata, are at the basis for enhanced reading system behaviors, as well as predictable content discovery and repurposing. </p>

    <p>To allow for the predictability of content within those domains that need it, <a>Portable Web Publications</a> may need to incorporate a notion of “profiles” that content can be authored and validated against, and that user agent implementations can use to trigger enhanced behaviors, if any. To allow for agile feature-set extensions and innovation, <a>Portable Web Publications</a> profiles also needs to embrace the notion of “feature addons” that can be included by a publisher without risking to invalidate the integrity and functionality of the basic publication.</p>

  <h2>Portable Web Publications and EPUB&nbsp;3</h2>

  <p>The development of the definitions of <a>Portable Web Publications</a> should not be made in isolation, given the diverse publishing ecosystems that already exist. Rather, the development should rely as much as possible on existing and deployed formats, which include both the various Open Web Platform technologies and digital publishing formats.</p>

  <p>Several document formats exist in the digital publishing domain; however, the only vendor independent and HTML based format is EPUB&nbsp;3[[EPUB3]], which emphasizes a dynamic determination of content presentation and a closer alignment with the Open Web Platform.  EPUB&nbsp;3 is built on Web Standards, and the individual items that make up an EPUB publication are identical to types of content on a Web site: [[html5]], [[svg]], [[css21]], [[ECMAScript]], [[JPEG]] and [[png]] images, etc. Various browser extensions supporting EPUB exist (e.g., <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readium/fepbnnnkkadjhjahcafoaglimekefifl">Readium in Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.epubread.com/en/">EPUBReader</a> in Firefox). Other solutions exist for delivering these files in browsers (<a href="http://readium.org/">Readium-Cloud</a>, <a href="https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/">EPUB.js</a>, <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books Online</a>, etc.). Publishers are actively exploring the new and possibly interactive possibilities offered by EPUB&nbsp;3; a good example is <a href="http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&bcsId=7005&itemId=1118087887">Cay Horstmann’s “Big Java, Late Objects”</a>[[BigJava]] that combines the feel of a traditional book with interactive learning materials that makes it reminiscent of similar, Web based tutorials (see the <a href="http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/horstmann/">video</a> on a companion page for the book)</p>

  <p>Whilst the concept of <a>Portable Web Publication</a> is close to, and has been inspired by, EPUB&nbsp;3, it goes beyond it, insofar as it emphasizes the need for a convergence between the offline and online usages. It would be highly desirable to deliver on the requirements on <a>Portable Web Publications</a> in an evolutionary manner that would build on, and would be backwards compatible with, existing EPUB&nbsp;3, since the latter is already widely deployed. However, this may not be possible. At this stage, this document emphasizes all requirements envisioned for <a>Portable Web Publications</a> without addressing the natural tension between goals of preserving compatibility and fully achieving all these requirements in the most elegant manner. But neither this end-goal emphasis, nor the use of the new term “<a>Portable Web Publication</a>”, should be taken as implying a recommendation to definitely create a completely new format that would replace EPUB. Further investigation is required, and the ongoing evolutionary trajectory of EPUB&nbsp;3 must also be taken into account.</p>

  <p class="note">The current evolution of EPUB&nbsp;3 towards EPUB&nbsp;3.1 will address several compatibility and convergence issues with the Open Web Platform; this will make the evolution path towards <a>Portable Web Publications</a> easier.</p>

  <p>It must also be emphasized that the central part of any EPUB&nbsp;3 publication, namely the <em>content</em>, will remain unchanged or will require only minimal changes when transitioning towards <a>Portable Web Publications</a>. The bulk of the changes are expected to occur around the accompanying constructs like publication-level metadata records, the spine, or the packaging format of the content. As described in the section <a href="#pwp_definition"></a>, the content of a <a>Portable Web Publication</a> is based on core <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a> technologies including [[html5]], [[svg]], or [[css21]], and other types of files like images, audio and video, metadata files, or executable code. Most of these are valid contents in EPUB&nbsp;3 already; a transition towards <a>Portable Web Publications</a> will leave these resources and their usage intact. The envisaged changes will be mostly restricted to the implementation details of reading systems and production workflows. The evolution of the past few years of online tooling for the production of EPUB content based on the Open Web Platform (e.g., the platforms developed and used by companies like O’Reilly, Hachette, Metrodigi, or Inkling) will also greatly facilitate any transition to <a>Portable Web Publications</a>; adapting these tools is expected to be quite straightforward.

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>This document outlines a vision for the convergence between the Open Web Platform and portable documents while also significantly advancing and expanding the existing digital publishing ecosystem. The realization of this vision would require a strong cooperation between the traditional publishing and Web communities, based on a close collaboration between the W3C and other relevant organizations, like <a href="http://idpf.org">IDPF</a>, <a href="http://editeur.org/">EDItEUR</a>, <a href="http://www.bisg.org">BISG</a>, or others. While it is envisaged that most of the work could be done in one or more dedicated Working Groups (within W3C or elsewhere, depending on the exact charter), it must be emphasized that many of the features will affect and will be affected by work done elsewhere, within or outside these organizations. The starting point will be to explore and plan for the detailed technical challenges to gain a better insight into the work ahead; this exploration should be done together with the various interested communities.
