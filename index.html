<section id="abstract">
  <p>
  This document introduces a user-focused vision of books as first-class
  citizens of the Web—with off-Web reading systems (beyond normal Web user
  agents) made superfluous, and
  “<a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>portable web publications</a>”
  made irrelevant.
  <p>
  The vision presented in this document is one of providing the best
  possible user experience for readers: A seamless reading experience that
  automatically remains consistent even as the user’s reading context
  changes.

  <p>
  So this vision assumes no user desire for “portability” of books, nor user
  desire to ever be required to “switch” into off-Web reading of electronic
  books, nor user desire for “convergence” of the reading experience of
  books on the Web with that of legacy reading systems. Instead, this
  document starts by reminding all that the fundamental quality of the Web,
  consciously designed into it by its creator from its very creation, is
  <i>Universality</i>.
  <p>
  This document outlines how to draw on that fundamental quality of
  Universality designed into the Web’s soul to build a user-first
  reading experience for books on the Web based the principle of the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">Priority of Constituencies</a>,
  always putting the needs of users first—above the needs of any other
  constituency.
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
  <p>This document outlines a general vision and should not be considered a
technical specification. Instead, its goal is to outline that vision and
the possible technical directions to achieve it; more detailed technical
work should be documented in separate documents.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="introduction">Our Vision</h2>

  <p class="vision">Our vision for <a>Portable Web Publications</a> is to define a class of documents on the Web that would be part of the Digital Publishing ecosystem but would also be fully native citizens of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>.  In this vision, the current format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable and online (Web) document publishing is diminished to zero. These are merely two dynamic manifestations of the same publication: content authored with online use as the primary mode can easily be saved by the user for offline reading in portable document form. Content authored primarily for use as a portable document can be put online, without any need for refactoring the content. Publishers can choose to utilize either or both of these publishing modes, and users can choose either or both of these consumption modes. Essential features flow seamlessly between online and offline modes; examples include cross-references, user annotations, access to online databases, as well as licensing and rights management.
  </p>

  <p>The precise definition of <a>Portable Web Publications</a> is provided in the section <a href='#pwp_definition'></a>. For the sake of this introduction, suffices to say that a <a>Portable Web Publication</a> is a collection of content items (e.g. pages, chapters, modules, articles) whose content is compatible with Web usage, and structured as a single, self-contained logical unit. Individual items can consist of text, images, graphics, possibly interactive mathematical or chemical formulae, as well as audio and video. These documents, by definition, have a default, linear “reading order”, however the user may choose to skip around in the content just as with a book on paper; alternatively, interactive aspects of the content may alter the reading order on behalf of the user.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="whynow">Why work on this now?</h2>
  <p>Digital Publishing can be considered to be at a tipping point. Digital publishing formats like EPUB have been broadly adopted globally for trade ebooks, and are starting to gain adoption among textbook publishers as well as corporate marketing departments. However, these formats have largely been seen as “offline” formats up until now. Various browser extensions supporting such complex publications exist, and other solutions are available for delivering these publications in browsers. Browser- and cloud-based solutions require relatively complex server and/or client software. In many cases browser- and cloud-based solutions depend on a proprietary transformation of the packaged files into formats more suitable to network delivery. A focused effort to make digital publications first-class Open Web Platform citizens will result in a significant reduction in the complexity of deploying publishing content into browsers for both online and offline consumption. Further, this focused effort will increase the momentum of digital publication and associated Web adoption across communities who are looking for an open, non-proprietary, next-generation portable document format.</p>

  <p>The broader Web Platform can also be considered to be at a tipping point. Mobile platform web site use is diminishing in favor of native applications. Hybrid applications that use web content alongside native application technology, and web-technology-based system applications are growing. The specific means of delivering hybrid and web-technology-based system applications is currently proprietary to specific applications frameworks and/or browser platforms. The point of Portable Web Publications is to increase problem solving momentum in package, metadata, and offline support applicable to both portable publications and installed applications. Open and native solutions to replace proprietary packaging, metadata, and offline support are intended to ensure the broadest possible general adoption of the Open Web Platform.
  </p>

  <p>In many respects, the convergence is already happening. In a number of areas (e.g., educational publications, travel books, etc.) publishers already exploit the advanced possibilities of packaged publishing formats to produce highly interactive documents whose features are very close to what one is used to on the Web (see the separate section <a href="#epub-relations"></a> for some examples). And the converse is also true: tutorial and introductory articles have appeared on the Web that have the quality of traditional publications that one was used to seeing in a scientific magazine, but combined with the interactive possibilities of the Web (<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike Bostock’s article on visualizing algorithms</a> or <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Bret Victor’s article on visualization</a> are just two of several possible examples). However, the convergence still has a long way to go, and this is the topic that this document, and the concept of <a>Portable Web Publications</a>, aim to explore.

  <h2>What are the areas of interest?</h2>

  <p>A principled approach to making books first-class citizens of the Web
  involves addressing the needs of the following stakeholders:

  <section>
    <h3>Users</h3>
    <p>The right approach to making the best possible user experience
    for <a>books on the Web</a> starts simply by meeting the needs of users
    first, beyond all other needs. The needs of other constituencies will
    naturally be addressed by meeting user needs (at least for other
    constituencies that are actually acting in good faith to meet user needs,
    instead of acting in practice against the best interests of users).

    <p>In contrast to the vision presented in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
    this document starts from a realization that users in fact do no want
    to be ushered (however subtly) into having to make choices among
    different reading systems for the same content, depending on the
    particular reading contexts they find themselves in. Users instead want
    a truly <i>universal</i> system for reading. Users want the Web.

    <p>Before 2008 or so, when smartphones and tablets capable of running full
    Web browsers with full access to the Web began to become prevalent,
    there was some value to users in having specialized off-Web devices with
    specialized reading systems. But for years now, users have actually had
    smartphones and tablets with full Web capabilities—so there is no longer any
    user need or desire for such specialized off-Web devices, nor for such
    legacy off-Web specialized reading systems.

    <p>Even in the case where, say, roaming charges are often high, or when
    internet access may be of low quality or not available at all, the Web
    itself—through
    <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>—provides
    users with the possibility to automatically have, in an easy manner,
    offline access at any time, anywhere, to any Web publication they are reading.

    <p>So the best possible user experience can now be provided to readers
    just through the power of the Web. A truly universal reading experience.

    <section>
    <h4>Secondary constituencies</h4>

    <p>Secondary constituencies who can help give readers the best possible user
    experience of <a>books on the Web</a>:
    <dl>
      <dt>Publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Book publishers are investing in the development of technical
      expertise in web technologies. While gaining understanding of technical
      topics is important to new and future publishing workflows, the lack of
      communication between the trade publishers and web-application developer
      communities is resulting in unnecessary duplication and investments in
      effort.</p>

      <p>Collaboration between the Web content development and publishing
      communities will result in major benefits to publishers. Moving to
      a truly user-first model of <a>books on the Web</a> that takes full
      advantage of the universality of the Web means publishers can concentrate
      on engaging content authors in the production of high quality content.

      <p>The web-content development community can be relied on to deal
      with sophisticated technical issues (e.g., CSS, SVG). Potential
      future web content formats (e.g., 3D rendering) and various
      interactive web programs (e.g., visualization tools like <a
      href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>) will naturally flow into the publishing
      realm by moving to a user-first model of <a>books on the Web</a>, hence
      increasing publishers’ opportunities to sell new content products
      across the board.</p>

      <p>Realizing new opportunities is a reality for publishers
      traditionally considered to be on the leading edge of technological
      advances in working with content. These publishers include
      <a href="#schol"><abbr title="Science, Technology, and
      Medical">STM</abbr> and educational publishing houses, as well as scholarly
      and journal publishing organizations</a>.</p>

      <p>A user-first model of <a>books on the Web</a> will support more
      tools and services and a much larger population of trained practitioners
      compared to the current state of working in parallel universes.</p>

      <dt id=schol>Scholarly journal and <abbr title="Science, Technology, and Medical">STM</abbr> publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Scholarly journal publishers also provide articles for download
      these days. The most popular distribution format for journal articles
      continues to be PDF—as a direct reflection of the scholarly community,
      which highly prioritizes linear text and preservation of print typography.
      Indeed, the original goal for scholarly publishers to make files available
      online was to enable readers to download and print content directly,
      instead of borrowing a paper copy of a journal issue and photocopying
      relevant articles.</p>

      <p>But things are changing. First of all, Web-only publications
      become part of the mainstream (e.g., the multidisciplinary <a
      href="http://www.plosone.org">PLOS ONE</a> or the new <a
      href="https://peerj.com/computer-science/">PeerJ CompSci</a> journals) with
      the main content being published using traditional Web technologies like
      HTML and CSS. And there is much more. Scholarly communication increasingly
      uses additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, or very
      large images, and the trend is to consider these as integral parts of the
      scientific output. (<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike
      Bostock’s recent article on visualizing algorithms</a> or the “live”
      presentation of data in a <a
      href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-176/v1#f3">paper published by
      F1000 Research</a> are good examples for the new possibilities.)
      <p>
      Furthermore, publishing the scientific <em>data sources</em>, like the
      results of, say,  a sociological survey or measurement output of biochemical
      experiments alongside the “main” publication, is
      also coming to the fore, with some journals and institutions actually
      requiring public access to those. Gaining truly universal access to all
      these various media and contents is important for scholars—in order
      for them to be able to read articles at any time, anywhere, without
      ever being forced into using off-Web reading systems.
      <p>
      And tools such as peer-review systems and bibliographic management systems
      like
      <a href="http://www.mendelay.com">Mendeley</a> or
      <a href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a>, to
      the degree they don’t yet handle 100% Web-based publications, will
      necessarily evolve to support them—in order to better meet the needs of
      scholars, and to provide the best possible user experience for scholars.

      <p>And as those tools evolve to actually put the needs of their scholarly
      users first, any requirement for authors to be forced to try to duplicate
      Web publications into redundant offline versions of the same
      content—in order to compensate for deficiencies and short-sightedness in
      the user model—will disappear.

      <p>And with the advent of
      <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>,
      things like user annotations, formal reviews, etc., can be performed
      by the scholar online or offline directly in Web applications running in a
      normal mobile browser on small, mobile devices—with no need for a separate
      redundant off-Web version of a publication, and so no need to ever be
      forced to have to synchronize the Web publication with any off-Web version.

      <p>The transformative effects of moving to a Web-first model that truly
      places the needs of users above all else will fundamentally change
      the way scholarly publishing works—for the better.

      <dt id=in-house-publishers>In-house publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>A special form of document production is related to technical
      and/or user documentation of complex products as well as complex
      administrative documents. Such documents are often akin to STM or scholarly
      publications edited by traditional trade or scholarly publishers—but,
      often, the sheer quantity and complexity of production, as well as
      confidentiality requirements, mean that the production are done in-house.
      In many respects major corporations such as IBM, Intel, Renault, or Boeing,
      or institutions like the European Commission, the FAO, or the UNESCO have
      become specialized publishers themselves.</p>

      <p>The quantity of such documentation makes it infeasible to produce these
      documents in print (or print-only); instead, Web-publishing them is
      the optimal way to provide the best possible user experience for them.

      <p>Just as for scientific publications, moving to a user-first model of
      <a>books on the Web</a> will provide new possibilities for these types of
      in-house publications. Using
      <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>,
      a Web publication can be made fully usable even when offline—in, for
      example, an airplane cockpit.

      <dt>Libraries and archival services</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>The archiving of digital assets is coming to the fore as a
      significant issue for dedicated institutions like national libraries. With
      the arrival of highly dynamic and possibly interactive Web publications as
      primary content, the traditional means of archiving (i.e., storing on some
      backup device for long term preservation) is no longer adequate.
      Web publications depend on a multitude of auxiliary files, like CSS
      stylesheets, images, videos, JavaScript programs, etc. The good news is
      that the Web itself already provides the means for archiving such
      publications, and there will be large growth in business opportunities
      for developers of systems that cater to this need well.

      <dt id=financial-reporting>Financial reporting</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>The domain of financial reporting is increasingly making use of
      dynamic and interactive content for reports published on the Web—but in
      order to meet legal, audit, and market requirements, it is important to be
      able to identify a specific, unchanging version of the document, including
      all auxiliary files it references.</p>

      <p>For example, financial reports must often be submitted to tax
      authorities, company registrars, stock exchanges, securities regulators,
      and other institutions, and it is critical to be able to identify the
      specific version that was filed, and to ensure that the document is not
      subsequently altered, including through changes to any external files that
      it references. Similarly, an auditor will give an opinion on a financial
      document, and it is important to be able to identify the exact version that
      was audited. These documents should be universally available in a
      common location for all parties to access, while still enabling
      confidentiality of the information among the parties.

      <p>The Web itself provides the means for both universally and
      confidentially serving snapshot versions of such reports to all
      authenticated users who need access to them. And in contrast to off-Web
      <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>portable web publications</a>,
      the Web itself—through standard Web features such as TLS
      (HTTPS) and
      <a href=https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/>Subresource Integrity</a>—provides
      for any user to fully and independently verify the provenance and
      integrity (against any tampering in transit) of any Web-published
      report—including the integrity of all auxiliary files it references; that
      is, the Web provides robust digital signing and non-repudiation mechanisms
      for such reports.

<section id="terminology">
  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>This document is based on the following definitions.</p>

  <section id="core_definition">
    <h2>Books on the Web</h2>

    <ul class="definition">
      <li>
      <p>The term
      <dfn data-lt="books on the Web|book on the Web|Web book">Books on the Web</dfn>
      itself is chosen to convey, in the clearest and simplest possible
      way, that a Web book is simply just a website, or a subdirectory or
      path within a website, with a Web URL from which the book is made
      available to readers—a URL that can be passed around (for example,
      sent to others via e-mail) and that forms a universal address for the
      book for potential access by anyone, anywhere.

      <p>
      And the term <i>book</i> is used here in part just as shorthand
      for any <a>Web publication</a>—a <a href=#schol>scholarly journal</a>, or an
      <a href=#in-house-publishers>in-house publication</a>, or a
      <a href=#financial-reporting>financial report</a>, or whatever other
      class of document published on the Web.

      <p>
      That said, books as a class are called out in this term because in
      practice currently, the user experience around reading books is often
      made unnecessarily different, in suboptimal ways, from the user
      experience of reading other classes of online publications—for example,
      online newspapers.

      <p>
      The difference with books in practice is that book readers are
      unnecessarily ushered into reading books in specialized off-Web reading
      systems that do not participate in the richness of the full feature set of
      the Web and so that do not provide users with the full advantages of the
      Web and the best user experience possible.

      <p>
      But there is no reason in principle why reading a book should
      ever require a user to need an off-Web reading system—any more than
      reading a newspaper should require a user to need an off-Web reading
      system. So the term <i>books on the Web</i> is meant to convey the
      lack of any need for a packaging mechanism like the one on which
      the vision in
      <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
      is premised.

      <p>
      If specialized reading systems are made superfluous, then there is no
      need for a “portable” package format for Web publications; instead, books
      and other publications can be universally accessed as 100% true
      <a>Web publications</a>—that is, just as <i>books on the Web</i>.

      <li>A <dfn data-lt="Web Publication|Web Publications">Web Publication</dfn>
      is a <a>Web Resource</a> which itself is an aggregated set of
      interrelated <a>Web Resources</a>, and which is intended to be considered
      as a single <a>Web Resource</a>. Furthermore:
        <ul>
          <li>As a <a>Web Resource</a>, a <a>Web Publication</a> has its
          own URL which refers to the <em>full set</em> of the constituent resources
          (as opposed to a particular <a>Web Resource</a> <em>within</em> the <a>Web
          Publication</a>).</li>

          <li>A <a>Web Publication</a> must be constructed of resources
          whose formats enable (individually or in conjunction with other resources
          in the same <a>Web Publication</a>) delivery of <a>essential content</a>
          and <a>functionality</a> based on standard technologies of the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>.

          <li>A <a>Web Publication</a> should provide

          of <a>content</a> to all users regardless of disability.

        </ul>
        (Note that
        <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
        redefines this term to include mention of delivery through
        undefined “delivery platforms” other than the Web.)
      </li>
      <li>A <dfn data-lt="Web Resource|Web Resources">Web Resource</dfn> is
      anything that can be uniquely addressed by a Web URL; that is, content
      that can be accessed through baseline Web protocols such as HTTP and
      through secure Web protocols such as HTTPS/TLS, and whose integrity
      can be verified using Web features such as
      <a href=https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/>Subresource Integrity</a>,
      etc.
      (Note that
      <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
      incorrectly redefines this term too broadly to include off-Web
      resources on a user’s local file system, not just resources actually
      on the Web.)

      <li><dfn>Content</dfn> of a <a>web resource</a>: information and sensory
      experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent,

      <li><dfn data-lt="Essential Content|essential">Essential Content</dfn>
      of a <a>Web Resource</a>: <a>content</a> which, if removed, would

      <li><dfn>Functionality</dfn> related to a <a>Web Resource</a>:
      processes and outcomes achievable through user action.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="note">The concepts of <a>content</a>, <a>essential
    content</a>, and <a>functionality</a> have been taken from the W3C
    <i>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</i> [[WCAG20]], thought slightly
    modified for this context.</p>

  <section id="offline_definition">
    <h3>Offline contexts for Web publications</h3>

    <p>It is important to understand that in order to be made available to
    users for reading offline, a Web publication never needs to
    go through any explicit transformation—specifically, a Web publication
    never needs to be packaged up into a “packed” off-Web format in the way
    described in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
    and so also then never needs to be “unpacked” for users to read
    in a different context.

    <p>
    So the only state actually changing in relation to the reading context
    is the state of a user’s Internet connection: A user is either online,
    with an active Internet connection, or offline, with no active Internet
    connection.

    <p>
    Ideally, to provide the best possible user experience for reading Web
    publications, a <a>Web publication</a> should remain readable and
    usable regardless of the current state of the user’s Internet connection.
    Users should be able to navigate to the URL for a <a>Web publication</a>
    while online, but then subsequently, even when the state of their
    Internet connection changes and the users are offline, they should still
    be able to seamlessly continue reading the <a>Web publication</a>, in a
    Web browser, at the same URL they originally navigated to.

    <p>
    <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>
    enable such a reading scenario—in which the reading experience remains
    seamlessly consistent even if the state of the user’s Internet connection
    changes.

    <p>
    It seems clear that users would prefer such a Service-Worker-enabled
    seamless reading experience—rather than, in the way described in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
    being required to instead deal with getting the <a>Web publication</a>
    transformed into a “packed” off-Web format, in preparation for reading offline,
    and then needing for that to be “unpacked” for the users to actually
    read in an offline context.

  </section>

<section>
  <h2>Achieving seamless reading experiences</h2>

  <p>This section provides details of an approach for providing users with
  the best possible user experience of <a>books on the Web</a>, and with
  <a>Web publications</a> in general—regardless of the state of users’
  connections to the Internet. It also list a number of non-requirements
  that don’t need to be considered when designing reading experiences for users
  that remain seamlessly consistent whether the users are online or offline.

  <section id="arch">
    <h3>General architecture and demo</h3>

    <p id="sworkers">
    <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>
    [[Service-Workers]]
    offer the means to provide users with a seamlessly consistent reading
    experience of a Web publication even if the state of the user’s
    Internet connection changes and the user drops offline.

    <p>
    Service Workers work by providing programmable local caching of
    <a>Web resources</a>, acting as a network proxy while a user is offline—in
    such a way the rest of the browser engine continues to behave just as it
    did when the user was online, but now with a Service Worker intercepting
    all network requests for any <a>Web resources</a> that are part of a
    particular <a>Web publication</a> and automatically re-routing them to
    be served from the local cache instead.

    <p>
    The end result for users is that nothing changes: Even while they are
    offline, their reading experience remains exactly the same—seamlessly
    consistent, even though the state of their Internet connection has
    changed.

    <p>
    In this architecture there is absolutely no need for any additional
    “packing” and “unpacking” steps such as those proposed in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>.
    Instead, Service Workers alone can provide all that is needed to ensure
    a seamless reading experience.

    <p>
    A proof-of-concept demo of a Service-Worker-offline-enabled Web
    publication is available at the following site:

    <p>
    <a href=https://lordzen.github.io/offline-book-demo/readme/>https://lordzen.github.io/offline-book-demo/readme/</a>

    <p>
    That demo is a modified version of an earlier demo developed by
    <a href=https://twitter.com/jaffathecake>Jake Archibald</a>.
    Jake has also created another demo that uses Service Workers in the
    same way to allow you to create your own custom “book” of Wikipedia pages
    to take offline for reading anywhere:

    <p>
    <a href=https://wiki-offline.jakearchibald.com/>https://wiki-offline.jakearchibald.com/</a>

    <p>
    It’s easy to imagine many other interesting demonstrations for making
    existing content readable offline.

  </section>

  <section id="package">
    <h3>No archive format needed</h3>

    <p>
    A Service-Worker-enabled <a>Web publication</a> requires no archiving
    step in order to remain readable while offline.

    So, given that the Web itself can provide a truly universal reading
    experience even when users are offline, there is no need for any
    archive format to provide “portability” of a <a>Web publication</a>
    to off-Web legacy reading systems in the way envisioned in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>.

  </section>

  <section id="manifest">
    <h3>No publication manifests needed</h3>

    <p>
    A Service-Worker-enabled <a>Web publication</a> requires no publication
    manifest in order to remain readable while offline.

    That said, an author or publisher might choose to use a manifest when
    implementing such a publication, and manifests can be useful for other
    purposes; they are just not a strict requirement for offline reading.

  </section>

  <section id="identification">
    <h3>No special addressing/identification needed</h3>

    <p>
    URLs (generally HTTP/HTTPS URLs) serve as universal addresses for
    resources on the Web. <a>Books on the Web</a> and all other <a>Web
    publications</a> are simply just websites, with URLs that are identify
    them. Therefore, <a>books on the Web</a> come with no special addressing
    needs. In terms of addressing and identification, <a>books on the Web</a>
    benefit from the same universality that all other Web resources enjoy.

    <p>
    Even when a user is offline, the user can read a previously-fetched
    Service-worker-offline-enabled book simply by navigating to that book’s
    universal address in a normal Web browser—that is, by browsing back to
    the same URL from which the user originally fetched the book for
    reading. When offline, the browser essentially uses an internal catalog
    to automatically map the URL for the book and the URLs for all its
    constituent resources to locally-cached locations from which it fetches
    the resources, rather then (re)fetching them over the Internet.

  </section>

  <section id="metadata">
    <h3>No special metadata needed</h3>

    <p>
    No special metadata is required to enable users to read a <a>Web book</a>
    or other <a>Web publication</a> offline. Because the state of a Web
    publication never changes whether the user is online or offline (only
    the state of the user’s Internet connection changes), and because to be
    readable offline, a Service-Worker-enabled Web publication never actually
    needs to leave the Web—in contrast to scenarios outlined in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
    where users are instead essentially required to have redundant “packed”
    copies of Web publications just to be able to read them offline, in
    separate off-Web reading systems—there are no special metadata requirements
    necessary for the scenario where a user is forced into using an off-Web
    copy of a Web publication. Such requirements are avoided just by never
    forcing users into needing to use off-Web copies.

  </section>

  <section id="styling">
    <h3>No new styling/layout/pagination needed</h3>

    <p>
    The requirements for taking the hard-copy printed-page conventions
    of paper books and other paged media and emulating them on the Web are
    either largely already known or are the subject of ongoing discussion
    in the W3C CSS Working Group. What mostly remains is just for
    browser-engine projects to implement support for solutions that have
    already been specified, and to continue working with other participants
    in the CSS Working Group to get the remaining solutions identified.
    Direct discussion in the CSS Working Group is the most productive means
    to ensure the necessary requirements get identified and addressed.

    <p>
    Regardless, the requirement to make <a>Web publications</a> readable
    offline—whether in the way outlined in this document or in the
    contrary way envisioned in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>—is
    completely orthogonal to any styling, layout, and pagination
    requirements. In other words, making Web publications readable by users
    offline introduces no new styling, layout, or pagination needs.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>No new security model needed</h3>

    <p>Service-worker-offline-enabled <a>books on the Web</a> are simply
    websites that are served to users under the standard Web security model
    whether the user is online or offline. So, in contrast to the scenarios
    envisioned in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
    where users are required to use separate off-Web reading systems in
    order to read documents offline—which would necessitate creating a
    corresponding off-Web security model of some kind—no new security model
    is needed.

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>No standard personalization control needed</h3>

    <p>
    The requirement to make <a>Web publications</a> readable offline—whether
    in the way outlined in this document or the contrary way envisioned in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>—is
    completely orthogonal to user abilities to personalize the presentation of
    a publication by adapting it to suit their needs.

    <p>
    Web browsers already provide some degree of built-in capabilities for
    users to personalize the presentation of Web publications as they read
    them (for example, to dynamically change font size as they read), and
    third-party browser extensions are also available for users to
    have a greater level of control over such presentation-related
    personalization (for example, to dynamically change background/foreground
    color schemes).

    <p>
    Authors and publishers of Web publications can also innovate in this
    area, by adding JavaScript code to enable their own built-in
    personalization controls in publications they provide to users. And
    JavaScript library developers can create shared libraries for authors and
    publishers to use for enabling such personalization controls.

    <p>
    So while there’s no disagreement on the value of users being provided
    with presentation-related personalization controls, there is no agreement
    to require any standard mechanisms for doing it. Instead, browser projects,
    extension developers, JavaScript-library creators, as well as authors and
    publishers can all innovate and compete in this area to try to produce
    the best possible user experience around such personalization.

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>No standard domain profiles needed</h3>

    <p>Different domains of publishing have different expectations
    from users around the nature of their content and their presentation.
    Educational publishers, for example, have a particular set of
    expectations from users for things like content structure and metadata.
    And comic books, for example, have a default presentation that is
    typically pre-paginated, fixed-form, and image-based, with a set of
    comic-book-reading user-interaction conventions commonly followed
    across publications from different authors and publishers.

    <p>
    However, it is a mistake to believe that the best way to address those
    domain-specific expectations is for standards organizations to attempt
    to produce designed-by-committee profiles that content can be authored
    and validated against (in order to produce predictability of content within
    particular domains, or for whatever other reasons). Past experiences have
    taught us that such attempts at producing domain-specific profiles of Web
    technologies are rarely successful—among other reasons because the market
    moves much faster than standards committees, and any specifications for
    profiles quickly become stale and irrelevant.

    <p>
    Instead, innovation in the area of addressing domain-specific user
    expectations for Web publications can and will just continue naturally
    in the market at the hands of JavaScript library creators,
    browser-extension developers, and authors and publishers themselves—as
    they compete and collaborate on new ideas about how to make the best
    possible user experiences for readers, as selling points to set their
    publications apart from others that are less creative about trying to
    meet specific domain expectations.

    <p>
    Occasionally, as such new ideas are allowed to incubate and mature
    naturally in the market, some agreement about standardizing particular
    mechanisms eventually emerges. But it is imprudent to attempt to prematurely
    mandate standard profiles or requirements before that natural
    incubation has had time to occur and mature.

  <h2>Why not do something EPUB-inspired?</h2>

  <p>
  EPUB merits mention here for being the inspiration behind the
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publication</a>
  idea envisioned in
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
  (the original title of which was in fact
  <a href=https://w3c.github.io/epubweb/>EPUB+WEB</a>.)

  <p>
  As an older format that was developed outside the W3C for use in
  specialized off-Web reading systems, EPUB was designed in the years before
  users had smartphones and tablets with full Web browsers. In those years,
  it made sense for users to carry low-capability devices that were
  specialized just for reading electronic books, and it made sense for there
  to be a format that targeted such users.

  <p>
  However, in the intervening years, EPUB and the general approach
  underlying it have increasingly faced criticism for not being at all a
  good match for current user needs; for one representative example, see
  the article
  “<a href=http://toc.oreilly.com/2013/02/the-publishing-industry-has-a-problem-and-epub-is-not-the-solution.html>The publishing industry has a problem, and EPUB is not the solution</a>”
  [[EPUB]] from Jani Patokallio (who at the time he wrote the article was
  working for the publisher Lonely Planet, and now works for Google).

  <p>
  The shared understanding underlying those criticisms of EPUB and the
  general notion of any similar “portable” document format is that
  since users have commonly had smartphones and tablets with full Web
  capabilities for years now, there is no longer any user requirement for
  specialized low-capability devices just to read electronic books, nor for
  legacy off-Web specialized reading systems—and so no longer any relevance
  for EPUB as a format, nor more generally for any EPUB-inspired
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publication</a>
  format as envisioned in
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>.

  <p>
  Instead what is needed is to look at the actual current user needs
  without concern for any existing legacy formats, and to start back from
  first principles and design fresh solutions—with the absolute highest
  priority given to user needs, over all other constituencies—and with the
  goal being purely to provide the best possible user experience of books on

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>This document outlines a vision for the convergence between the Open Web Platform and portable documents while also significantly advancing and expanding the existing digital publishing ecosystem. The realization of this vision would require a strong cooperation between the traditional publishing and Web communities, based on a close collaboration between the W3C and other relevant organizations, like <a href="http://idpf.org">IDPF</a>, <a href="http://editeur.org/">EDItEUR</a>, <a href="http://www.bisg.org">BISG</a>, or others. While it is envisaged that most of the work could be done in one or more dedicated Working Groups (within W3C or elsewhere, depending on the exact charter), it must be emphasized that many of the features will affect and will be affected by work done elsewhere, within or outside these organizations. The starting point will be to explore and plan for the detailed technical challenges to gain a better insight into the work ahead; this exploration should be done together with the various interested communities.
