  <p>
  This document introduces a user-focused vision of books as first-class
  citizens of the Web‚Äîwith off-Web reading systems (beyond normal Web user
  agents) made superfluous, and
  ‚Äú<a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications</a>‚Äù
  made irrelevant.
  <p>
  The vision presented in this document is one of providing the best
  possible user experience for readers: A seamless reading experience that
  automatically remains consistent even as the user‚Äôs reading context
  changes.

  <p>
  So this vision assumes no user desire for ‚Äúportability‚Äù of books, nor user
  desire to ever be required to ‚Äúswitch‚Äù into off-Web reading of electronic
  books, nor user desire for ‚Äúconvergence‚Äù of the reading experience of
  books on the Web with that of legacy reading systems. Instead, this
  document starts by reminding all that the fundamental quality of the Web,
  consciously designed into it by its creator from its very creation, is
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/04/Japan/Lecture.html">Universality</a>.
  <p>
  This document outlines how to draw on that fundamental quality of
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/04/Japan/Lecture.html">Universality</a>
  designed into the Web‚Äôs soul to build a user-first, <i>universal</i>
  reading experience for books on the Web based the principle of the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">Priority of Constituencies</a>[[Priority-of-Constituencies]],
  always putting the needs of users first‚Äîabove the needs of any other
  constituency.
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
  <p>This document outlines a particular vision. It is not a technical
  specification, but it does describe a specific technical direction
  for making the vision a reality.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="introduction">Our Vision</h2>

  <div class="vision">
  <p>
  Our vision of <a>Books on the Web</a> is for <a>Web books</a> to become
  true first-class citizens of the Web, with user needs given the very
  highest priority and thus with the focus on enabling the absolute best
  possible user experience for readers of <a>Web books</a> and other
  <a>Web publications</a>, by providing users with a
  <a href=#seamless>seamless reading experience that remains consistent
  even if the state of a user‚Äôs Internet connection changes</a>‚Äîso that
  users can just always continue reading right on the Web, regardless of
  whether the users are offline or online.

  <p>
  We believe that such a
  <a href=#seamless>seamless reading experience for users</a>,
  using a truly 100% Web-based approach, is very clearly the right way to
  achieve a
  <a href=https://www.w3.org/2015/09/digpubig.html>‚Äúzero format- and
  workflow-level separation between offline and online‚Äù</a> goal.

  <p>
  Further, we believe it is clear that ‚Äúzero separation between offline
  and online‚Äù goal can be met without any kind of
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>‚ÄúPortable Web Publication‚Äù</a>
  format, and in fact without resort in any way to the notion of
  ‚Äúportability‚Äù‚Äîbut instead based just on the Web‚Äôs fundamental quality of
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/04/Japan/Lecture.html">Universality</a>[[Universality]],
  never requiring users to download copies of <a>Web publications</a>
  in order to read them offline but instead requiring nothing more from users
  than to simply browse to the URL for a <a>Web publication</a> in exactly
  the same way they normally would, and subsequently just be able to
  automatically continue to access that <a>Web publication</a> at that same
  URL regardless of whether they are offline or online. In other words, a
  truly <b>universal</b> reading experience.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="whynow">Why work on this now?</h2>

  <p>
  In June 2013, the W3C launched a new
  <a href=https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/Main_Page>‚ÄúDigital Publishing‚Äù Interest Group</a>
  with
  <a href=https://www.w3.org/2015/09/digpubig.html>a charter for the group</a>
  that states the following goal:


  <blockquote>
  <p>
  <i>the current format- and workflow-level separation between
  offline/portable and online document publishing should be diminished to
  zero</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  The W3C is now considering proposals for achieving that ‚Äúzero separation
  between offline and online‚Äù goal for <a>Web publications</a>, and this
  document outlines a specific concrete technical direction for making that
  actually happen‚Äîfor making it a reality, rather just a vision.

  <p>
  However, the W3C is considering to instead invest organizationally in
  a contrary direction based on the much vaguer idea of an EPUB-inspired
  ‚Äú<a href=https://w3c.github.io/epubweb/>EPUB+WEB</a>‚Äù
  ‚ÄúPortable Web Publication‚Äù format as envisioned in
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
  and as illustrated in <a href=#pwp_figure></a>.

  <figure id="pwp_figure" style="width: 50rem">
    <img src="figures/pwp.svg"
     alt="Illustration of conceptial model in which Web content needs to be ‚Äúpacked‚Äù and ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù for use on a smartphone.">
    <figcaption>Flawed conceptual model that assumes needing to ‚Äúpackage‚Äù
    and ‚Äúunpackage‚Äù Web publications just to be readable offline or on
    mobile devices</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
  It would be a mistake to invest in that or any direction that is based
  on the assumption that the solution needed is a ‚Äúportable‚Äù document format
  usable outside of the Web.

  <p>
  To be very clear about the distinction, a reading system is not part of the Web if:

  <ul>
    <li>the reading system does not use URLs
    <li>the reading system does not use the Web security model
    <li>the reading system requires users to deal with the extra steps of
    having a ‚Äúpacked‚Äù Web publication, copied off its home on the Web,
    that then needs to be ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù in order for the user to read it
   </ul>

  <p>
  Such a reading system is instead just part of the <i>non-</i>Web, and
  designing any solution for users that optimizes for ‚Äúportability‚Äù to such
  off-Web reading systems is a mistake. While a document format that is
  ‚Äúportable‚Äù into such off-Web reading systems may solve problems for
  constituencies other than users, it is absolutely not the right way to
  provide the best possible user experience for users themselves.

  <p>
  So instead of designing for ‚Äúportability‚Äù, what‚Äôs actually needed is to
  design for
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/04/Japan/Lecture.html">universality</a>[[Universality]]‚Äîusing
  a true 100% Web-based approach that doesn‚Äôt require users to download
  copies of <a>Web publications</a> in order to read them offline but instead
  requires nothing more from users than to simply browse to the URL for a
  <a>Web publication</a> in exactly the same way they normally would, and
  subsequently just be able to automatically continue to access that
  <a>Web publication</a> at that same URL regardless of whether they are
  offline or online.

  <p>
  Explaining how such
  <a href=#seamless>seamlessly consistent reading experiences of Web publications</a>
  can be achieved for users is the purpose of this document‚Äîas well as
  making clear why the direction outlined in this document is a much better
  solution for providing the best possible user experience to users‚Äîand truly
  achieving the ‚Äúzero format- and workflow-level separation between offline
  and online‚Äù goal in the
  <a href=https://www.w3.org/2015/09/digpubig.html>‚ÄúDigital Publishing‚Äù Interest Group charter</a>‚Äîthan
  is the contrary direction outlined in
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>.

<section>
  <h2>What are the areas of interest?</h2>

  <p>A principled approach to making books first-class citizens of the Web
  involves addressing the needs of the following stakeholders:

  <section>
    <h3>Users</h3>
    <p>The right approach to making the best possible user experience
    for <a>books on the Web</a> starts simply by meeting the needs of users
    first, beyond all other needs. The needs of other constituencies will
    naturally be addressed by meeting user needs (at least for other
    constituencies that are actually acting in good faith to meet user needs,
    instead of acting in practice against the best interests of users).

    <p>In contrast to the vision presented in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
    this document starts from a realization that users in fact do no want
    to be ushered (however subtly) into having to make choices among
    different reading systems for the same content, depending on the
    particular reading contexts they find themselves in. Users instead want
    a truly <i>universal</i> system for reading. Users want the Web.

    <p>Before 2008 or so, when smartphones and tablets capable of running full
    Web browsers with full access to the Web began to become prevalent,
    there was some value to users in having specialized off-Web devices with
    specialized reading systems. But for years now, users have actually had
    smartphones and tablets with full Web capabilities‚Äîso there is no longer any
    user need or desire for such specialized off-Web devices, nor for such
    legacy off-Web specialized reading systems.

    <p>Even in the case where, say, roaming charges are often high, or when
    internet access may be of low quality or not available at all, the Web
    itself‚Äîthrough
    <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>‚Äîprovides
    users with the possibility to automatically have, in an easy manner,
    offline access at any time, anywhere, to any <a>Web publication</a> they
    are reading.

    <p>So the best possible user experience can now be provided to readers just
    through the power of the Web. A truly <i>universal</i> reading experience.

    <section>
    <h4>Secondary constituencies</h4>

    <p>Secondary constituencies who can help give readers the best possible user
    experience of <a>books on the Web</a>:
    <dl>
      <dt>Publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Book publishers are investing in the development of technical
      expertise in web technologies. While gaining understanding of technical
      topics is important to new and future publishing workflows, the lack of
      communication between the trade publishers and web-application developer
      communities is resulting in unnecessary duplication and investments in
      effort.</p>

      <p>Collaboration between the Web content development and publishing
      communities will result in major benefits to publishers. Moving to
      a truly user-first model of <a>books on the Web</a> that takes full
      advantage of the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/04/Japan/Lecture.html">universality</a>[[Universality]]
      of the Web means publishers can concentrate on engaging content
      authors in the production of high quality content.

      <p>Along with familiar, established Web technologies such as CSS and
      SVG, support for technologies enabling features such as 3D rendering
      (and even visualization tools such as <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>)
      will naturally flow into the publishing realm by moving to a user-first
      model of <a>books on the Web</a>, hence increasing publishers‚Äô
      opportunities to sell new content products across the board.</p>

      <p>Realizing new opportunities is a reality for publishers
      traditionally considered to be on the leading edge of technological
      advances in working with content. These publishers include
      <a href="#schol"><abbr title="Science, Technology, and
      Medical">STM</abbr> and educational publishing houses, as well as scholarly
      and journal publishing organizations</a>.</p>

      <p>A user-first model of <a>books on the Web</a> will support more
      tools and services and a much larger population of trained practitioners
      compared to the current state of working in parallel universes.</p>

      <dt id=schol>Scholarly journal and <abbr title="Science, Technology, and Medical">STM</abbr> publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Scholarly journal publishers also provide articles for download
      these days. The most popular distribution format for journal articles
      continues to be PDF‚Äîas a direct reflection of the scholarly community,
      which highly prioritizes linear text and preservation of print typography.
      Indeed, the original goal for scholarly publishers to make files available
      online was to enable readers to download and print content directly,
      instead of borrowing a paper copy of a journal issue and photocopying
      relevant articles.</p>

      <p>But things are changing. First of all, Web-only publications
      become part of the mainstream (e.g., the multidisciplinary <a
      href="http://www.plosone.org">PLOS ONE</a> or the new <a
      href="https://peerj.com/computer-science/">PeerJ CompSci</a> journals) with
      the main content being published using traditional Web technologies like
      HTML and CSS. And there is much more. Scholarly communication increasingly
      uses additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, or very
      large images, and the trend is to consider these as integral parts of the
      scientific output. (<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike
      Bostock‚Äôs recent article on visualizing algorithms</a> or the ‚Äúlive‚Äù
      presentation of data in a <a
      href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-176/v1#f3">paper published by
      F1000 Research</a> are good examples for the new possibilities.)
      <p>
      Furthermore, publishing the scientific <em>data sources</em>, like the
      results of, say,  a sociological survey or measurement output of biochemical
      experiments alongside the ‚Äúmain‚Äù publication, is
      also coming to the fore, with some journals and institutions actually
      requiring public access to those. Gaining truly universal access to all
      these various media and contents is important for scholars‚Äîin order
      for them to be able to read articles at any time, anywhere, without
      ever being forced into using off-Web reading systems.
      <p>
      And tools such as peer-review systems and bibliographic management systems
      like
      <a href="http://www.mendelay.com">Mendeley</a> or
      <a href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a>, to
      the degree they don‚Äôt yet handle 100% Web-based publications, will
      necessarily evolve to support them‚Äîin order to better meet the needs of
      scholars, and to provide the best possible user experience for scholars.

      <p>And as those tools evolve to actually put the needs of their scholarly
      users first, any requirement for authors to be forced to try to duplicate
      <a>Web publications</a> into redundant offline versions of the same
      content‚Äîin order to compensate for deficiencies and short-sightedness in
      the user model‚Äîwill disappear.

      <p>And with the advent of
      <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>,
      things like user annotations, formal reviews, etc., can be performed
      by the scholar online or offline directly in Web applications running in a
      normal mobile browser on small, mobile devices‚Äîwith no need for a separate
      redundant off-Web version of a publication, and so no need to ever be
      forced to have to synchronize the <a>Web publication</a> with any off-Web
      version.

      <p>The transformative effects of moving to a Web-first model that truly
      places the needs of users above all else will fundamentally change
      the way scholarly publishing works‚Äîfor the better.

      <dt id=in-house-publishers>In-house publishers</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>A special form of document production is related to technical
      and/or user documentation of complex products as well as complex
      administrative documents. Such documents are often akin to STM or scholarly
      publications edited by traditional trade or scholarly publishers‚Äîbut,
      often, the sheer quantity and complexity of production, as well as
      confidentiality requirements, mean that the production are done in-house.
      In many respects major corporations such as IBM, Intel, Renault, or Boeing,
      or institutions like the European Commission, the FAO, or the UNESCO have
      become specialized publishers themselves.</p>

      <p>The quantity of such documentation makes it infeasible to produce these
      documents in print (or print-only); instead, Web-publishing them is
      the optimal way to provide the best possible user experience for them.

      <p>Just as for scientific publications, moving to a user-first model of
      <a>books on the Web</a> will provide new possibilities for these types of
      in-house publications. Using
      <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>,
      a <a>Web publication</a> can be made fully usable even when offline‚Äîin, for
      example, an airplane cockpit.

      <dt>Libraries and archival services</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>The archiving of digital assets is coming to the fore as a
      significant issue for dedicated institutions like national libraries. With
      the arrival of highly dynamic and possibly interactive <a>Web publications</a>
      as primary content, the traditional means of archiving (i.e., storing on some
      backup device for long term preservation) is no longer adequate.
      <a>Web publications</a> depend on a multitude of auxiliary files, like CSS
      stylesheets, images, videos, JavaScript programs, etc. The good news is
      that the Web itself already provides the means for archiving such
      publications, and there will be large growth in business opportunities
      for developers of systems that cater to this need well.

      <dt id=financial-reporting>Financial reporting</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>The domain of financial reporting is increasingly making use of
      dynamic and interactive content for reports published on the Web‚Äîbut in
      order to meet legal, audit, and market requirements, it is important to be
      able to identify a specific, unchanging version of the document, including
      all auxiliary files it references.</p>

      <p>For example, financial reports must often be submitted to tax
      authorities, company registrars, stock exchanges, securities regulators,
      and other institutions, and it is critical to be able to identify the
      specific version that was filed, and to ensure that the document is not
      subsequently altered, including through changes to any external files that
      it references. Similarly, an auditor will give an opinion on a financial
      document, and it is important to be able to identify the exact version that
      was audited. These documents should be universally available in a
      common location for all parties to access, while still enabling
      confidentiality of the information among the parties.

      <p>The Web itself provides the means for both universally and
      confidentially serving snapshot versions of such reports to all
      authenticated users who need access to them. And in contrast to off-Web
      <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications</a>,
      the Web itself‚Äîthrough standard Web features such as TLS (HTTPS) and

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>This document is based on the following definitions.</p>

  <section id="core_definition">
    <h2>Books on the Web</h2>

    <ul class="definition">
      <li>
      <p>The term
      <dfn data-lt="books on the Web|book on the Web|Web book|web books">Books on the Web</dfn>
      itself is chosen to convey, in the clearest and simplest possible
      way, that a Web book is simply just a website, or a subdirectory or
      path within a website, with a Web URL from which the book is made
      available to readers‚Äîa URL that can be passed around (for example,
      sent to others via e-mail) and that forms a universal address for the
      book for potential access by anyone, anywhere.

      <p>
      And the term <i>book</i> is used here in part just as shorthand
      for any <a>Web publication</a>‚Äîa <a href=#schol>scholarly journal</a>, or an
      <a href=#in-house-publishers>in-house publication</a>, or a
      <a href=#financial-reporting>financial report</a>, or whatever other
      class of document published on the Web.

      <p>
      That said, books as a class are called out in this term because in
      practice currently, the user experience around reading books is often
      made unnecessarily different, in suboptimal ways, from the user
      experience of reading other classes of online publications‚Äîfor example,
      online newspapers.

      <p>
      The difference with books in practice is that book readers are
      unnecessarily ushered into reading books in specialized off-Web reading
      systems that do not participate in the richness of the full feature set of
      the Web and so that do not provide users with the full advantages of the
      Web and the best user experience possible.

      <p>
      But there is no reason in principle why reading a book should
      ever require a user to need an off-Web reading system‚Äîany more than
      reading a newspaper should require a user to need an off-Web reading
      system. So the term <i>books on the Web</i> is meant to convey the
      lack of any need for a packaging mechanism like the one on which
      the vision in
      <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
      is premised.

      <p>
      If specialized reading systems are made superfluous, then there is no
      need for a ‚Äúportable‚Äù package format for <a>Web publications</a>;
      instead, books and other publications can be universally accessed as
      100% true <a>Web publications</a>‚Äîthat is, just as <i>books on the Web</i>.

      <li>A <dfn data-lt="Web Publication|Web Publications">Web Publication</dfn>
      is a <a>Web Resource</a> which itself is an aggregated set of
      interrelated <a>Web Resources</a>, and which is intended to be considered
      as a single <a>Web Resource</a>. Furthermore:
        <ul>
          <li>As a <a>Web Resource</a>, a <a>Web Publication</a> has its
          own URL which refers to the <em>full set</em> of the constituent resources
          (as opposed to a particular <a>Web Resource</a> <em>within</em> the <a>Web
          Publication</a>).</li>

          <li>A <a>Web Publication</a> must be constructed of resources
          whose formats enable (individually or in conjunction with other resources
          in the same <a>Web Publication</a>) delivery of <a>essential content</a>
          and <a>functionality</a> based on standard technologies of the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>.

          <li>A <a>Web Publication</a> should provide
          <a href=https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility>accessibility</a>
          of <a>content</a> to all users regardless of disability.

        </ul>
        (Note that
        <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
        redefines this term to include mention of delivery through
        undefined ‚Äúdelivery platforms‚Äù other than the Web.)
      </li>
      <li>A <dfn data-lt="Web Resource|Web Resources">Web Resource</dfn> is
      anything that can be uniquely addressed by a Web URL; that is, content
      that can be accessed through baseline Web protocols such as HTTP and
      through secure Web protocols such as HTTPS/TLS, and whose integrity
      can be verified using Web features such as
      <a href=https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/>Subresource Integrity</a>,
      etc.
      (Note that
      <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
      incorrectly redefines this term too broadly to include off-Web
      resources on a user‚Äôs local file system, not just resources actually
      on the Web.)

      <li><dfn>Content</dfn> of a <a>web resource</a>: information and sensory
      experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent,
      including code or markup that defines the content‚Äôs structure,

      <li><dfn data-lt="Essential Content|essential">Essential Content</dfn>
      of a <a>Web Resource</a>: <a>content</a> which, if removed, would

      Resource</a>.</li>

      <li><dfn>Functionality</dfn> related to a <a>Web Resource</a>:
      processes and outcomes achievable through user action.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="note">The concepts of <a>content</a>, <a>essential
    content</a>, and <a>functionality</a> have been taken from the W3C

    though slightly modified for this context.</p>

  <section id="offline_definition">
    <h3>Offline contexts for Web publications</h3>

    <p>It is important to understand that in order to be made available to
    users for reading offline, a <a>Web publication</a> never needs to
    go through any explicit transformation‚Äîspecifically, a <a>Web publication</a>
    never needs to be packaged up into a ‚Äúpacked‚Äù off-Web format in the way
    described in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
    and so also then never needs to be ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù for users to read
    in a different context.

    <p>
    So the only state actually changing in relation to the reading context
    is the state of a user‚Äôs Internet connection: A user is either online,
    with an active Internet connection, or offline, with no active Internet
    connection.

    <p>
    Ideally, to provide the best possible user experience for reading Web
    publications, a <a>Web publication</a> should remain readable and
    usable regardless of the current state of the user‚Äôs Internet connection.
    Users should be able to navigate to the URL for a <a>Web publication</a>
    while online, but then subsequently, even when the state of their
    Internet connection changes and the users are offline, they should still
    be able to seamlessly continue reading the <a>Web publication</a>, in a
    Web browser, at the same URL they originally navigated to.

    <p>
    <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>
    enable such a reading scenario‚Äîin which the
    <a href=#seamless>reading experience remains seamlessly consistent</a>
    even if the state of the user‚Äôs Internet connection changes.

    <p>
    It seems clear that users would prefer such a Service-Worker-enabled
    seamless reading experience‚Äîrather than, in the way described in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>,
    being required to instead deal with getting the <a>Web publication</a>
    transformed into a ‚Äúpacked‚Äù off-Web format, in preparation for reading offline,
    and then needing for that to be ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù for the users to actually
    read in an offline context.

  </section>

<section id=seamless>
  <h2>Enabling seamless reading experiences</h2>

  <p>This section provides details of an approach for providing users with
  the best possible user experience of <a>books on the Web</a>, and with
  <a>Web publications</a> in general‚Äîregardless of the state of users‚Äô
  connections to the Internet. It also lists a number of non-requirements
  that don‚Äôt need to be considered when designing reading experiences for users
  that remain seamlessly consistent whether the users are online or offline.

  <section id="arch">
    <h3>General architecture and demo</h3>

    <p id="sworkers">
    <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>[[Service-Workers]]
    offer the means to provide users with a seamlessly consistent reading
    experience of a <a>Web publication</a> even if the state of the user‚Äôs
    Internet connection changes and the user drops offline.

    <p>
    Service Workers work by providing programmable local caching of
    <a>Web resources</a>, acting as a network proxy while a user is offline‚Äîin
    such a way the rest of the browser engine continues to behave just as it
    did when the user was online, but now with a Service Worker intercepting
    all network requests for any <a>Web resources</a> that are part of a
    particular <a>Web publication</a> and automatically re-routing them to
    be served from the local cache instead.

    <p>
    The end result for users is that nothing changes: Even while they are
    offline, their reading experience remains exactly the same‚Äîseamlessly
    consistent, even though the state of their Internet connection has
    changed.

    <p>
    In this architecture there is absolutely no need for any additional
    ‚Äúpacking‚Äù and ‚Äúunpacking‚Äù steps such as those proposed in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>.
    Instead, Service Workers alone can provide all that is needed to ensure
    a seamless reading experience.

    <p>
    For proof-of-concept demonstrations of Service-Worker-offline-enabled
    <a>Web publications</a>, see the following:

    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://lordzen.github.io/offline-book-demo/readme/">A simple ‚Äúreadme‚Äù document</a> that provides
    more details and explains how to view the demo content offline.
    <li><a href="https://lordzen.github.io/offline-book-demo/treasure-island/">Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs <i>Treasure Island</i> as a offline-enabled web book</a>‚Äîall
    34 chapters, plus all 115 of Louis Rhead‚Äôs illustrations from the 1915
    Harper‚Äôs edition of the novel.
    </ul>

    <p>
    Both are based on code from an earlier demo developed by
    <a href=https://twitter.com/jaffathecake>Jake Archibald</a>.
    Jake has also created another demo that uses Service Workers in the
    same way to allow you to create your own custom ‚Äúbook‚Äù of Wikipedia pages
    to take offline for reading anywhere:

    <p>
    <a href=https://wiki-offline.jakearchibald.com/>https://wiki-offline.jakearchibald.com/</a>

    <p>
    It‚Äôs easy to imagine many other interesting demonstrations for making
    existing content readable offline.

  </section>

  <section id="package">
    <h3>No archive format needed</h3>

    <p>
    A Service-Worker-enabled <a>Web publication</a> requires no archiving
    step in order to remain readable while offline.

    So, given that the Web itself can provide a truly universal reading
    experience even when users are offline, there is no need for any
    archive format to provide ‚Äúportability‚Äù of a <a>Web publication</a>
    to off-Web legacy reading systems in the way envisioned in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>.

  </section>

  <section id="manifest">
    <h3>No publication manifests needed</h3>

    <p>
    A Service-Worker-enabled <a>Web publication</a> requires no publication
    manifest in order to remain readable while offline.

    That said, an author or publisher might choose to use a manifest when
    implementing such a publication, and manifests can be useful for other
    purposes; they are just not a strict requirement for offline reading.

  </section>

  <section id="identification">
    <h3>No special addressing/identification needed</h3>

    <p>
    URLs (generally HTTP/HTTPS URLs) serve as universal addresses for
    resources on the Web. <a>Books on the Web</a> and all other <a>Web
    publications</a> are simply just websites, with URLs that are identify
    them. Therefore, <a>books on the Web</a> come with no special addressing
    needs. In terms of addressing and identification, <a>books on the Web</a>
    benefit from the same
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/04/Japan/Lecture.html">universality</a>[[Universality]]
    that all other Web resources enjoy.

    <p>
    Even when a user is offline, the user can read a previously-fetched
    Service-worker-offline-enabled book simply by navigating to that book‚Äôs
    universal address in a normal Web browser‚Äîthat is, by browsing back to
    the same URL from which the user originally fetched the book for
    reading. When offline, the browser essentially uses an internal catalog
    to automatically map the URL for the book and the URLs for all its
    constituent resources to locally-cached locations from which it fetches
    the resources, rather then (re)fetching them over the Internet.

  </section>

  <section id="metadata">
    <h3>No special metadata needed</h3>

    <p>
    No special metadata is required to enable users to read a <a>Web book</a>
    or other <a>Web publication</a> offline. Because the state of a Web
    publication never changes whether the user is online or offline (only
    the state of the user‚Äôs Internet connection changes), and because to be
    readable offline, a Service-Worker-enabled <a>Web publication</a> never
    actually needs to leave the Web‚Äîin contrast to scenarios outlined in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
    where users are instead essentially required to have redundant ‚Äúpacked‚Äù
    copies of <a>Web publications</a> just to be able to read them offline, in
    separate off-Web reading systems‚Äîthere are no special metadata requirements
    necessary for the scenario where a user is forced into using an off-Web
    copy of a <a>Web publication</a>. Such requirements are avoided just by
    never forcing users into needing to use off-Web copies.

  </section>

  <section id="styling">
    <h3>No new styling/layout/pagination needed</h3>

    <p>
    The requirements for taking the hard-copy printed-page conventions
    of paper books and other paged media and emulating them on the Web are
    either largely already known or are the subject of ongoing discussion
    in the W3C CSS Working Group. What mostly remains is just for
    browser-engine projects to implement support for solutions that have
    already been specified, and to continue working with other participants
    in the CSS Working Group to get the remaining solutions identified.
    Direct discussion in the CSS Working Group is the most productive means
    to ensure the necessary requirements get identified and addressed.

    <p>
    Regardless, the requirement to make <a>Web publications</a> readable
    offline‚Äîwhether in the way outlined in this document or in the
    contrary way envisioned in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>‚Äîis
    completely orthogonal to any styling, layout, and pagination
    requirements. In other words, making <a>Web publications</a> readable by
    users offline introduces no new styling, layout, or pagination needs.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>No new security model needed</h3>

    <p>Service-worker-offline-enabled <a>books on the Web</a> are simply
    websites that are served to users under the standard Web security model
    whether the user is online or offline. So, in contrast to the scenarios
    envisioned in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
    where users are required to use separate off-Web reading systems in
    order to read documents offline‚Äîwhich would necessitate creating a
    corresponding off-Web security model of some kind‚Äîno new security model
    is needed.

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>No standard personalization control needed</h3>

    <p>
    The requirement to make <a>Web publications</a> readable offline‚Äîwhether
    in the way outlined in this document or the contrary way envisioned in
    <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>‚Äîis
    completely orthogonal to user abilities to personalize the presentation of
    a publication by adapting it to suit their needs.

    <p>
    Web browsers already provide some degree of built-in capabilities for
    users to personalize the presentation of <a>Web publications</a> as they
    read them (for example, to dynamically change font size as they read),
    and third-party browser extensions are also available for users to
    have a greater level of control over such presentation-related
    personalization (for example, to dynamically change background/foreground
    color schemes).

    <p>
    Authors and publishers of <a>Web publications</a> can also innovate in
    this area, by adding JavaScript code to enable their own built-in
    personalization controls in publications they provide to users. And
    JavaScript library developers can create shared libraries for authors and
    publishers to use for enabling such personalization controls.

    <p>
    So while there‚Äôs no disagreement on the value of users being provided
    with presentation-related personalization controls, there is no agreement
    to require any standard mechanisms for doing it. Instead, browser projects,
    extension developers, JavaScript-library creators, as well as authors and
    publishers can all innovate and compete in this area to try to produce
    the best possible user experience around such personalization.

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>No standard domain profiles needed</h3>

    <p>Different domains of publishing have different expectations
    from users around the nature of their content and their presentation.
    Educational publishers, for example, have a particular set of
    expectations from users for things like content structure and metadata.
    And comic books, for example, have a default presentation that is
    typically pre-paginated, fixed-form, and image-based, with a set of
    comic-book-reading user-interaction conventions commonly followed
    across publications from different authors and publishers.

    <p>
    However, it is a mistake to believe that the best way to address those
    domain-specific expectations is for standards organizations to attempt
    to produce designed-by-committee profiles that content can be authored
    and validated against (in order to produce predictability of content within
    particular domains, or for whatever other reasons). Past experiences have
    taught us that such attempts at producing domain-specific profiles of Web
    technologies are rarely successful‚Äîamong other reasons because the market
    moves much faster than standards committees, and any specifications for
    profiles quickly become stale and irrelevant.

    <p>
    Instead, innovation in the area of addressing domain-specific user
    expectations for <a>Web publications</a> can and will just continue
    naturally in the market at the hands of JavaScript library creators,
    browser-extension developers, and authors and publishers themselves‚Äîas
    they compete and collaborate on new ideas about how to make the best
    possible user experiences for readers, as selling points to set their
    publications apart from others that are less creative about trying to
    meet specific domain expectations.

    <p>
    Occasionally, as such new ideas are allowed to incubate and mature
    naturally in the market, some agreement about standardizing particular
    mechanisms eventually emerges. But it is imprudent to attempt to prematurely
    mandate standard profiles or requirements before that natural
    incubation has had time to occur and mature.

<section id="epub-relations">
  <h2>Why not do something EPUB-inspired?</h2>

  <p>
  EPUB merits mention here for being the inspiration behind the
  ‚ÄúPortable Web Publication‚Äù idea envisioned in
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>
  (the original title of which was in fact
  <a href=https://w3c.github.io/epubweb/>EPUB+WEB</a>).

  <p>
  As an older format that was developed outside the W3C for use in
  specialized off-Web reading systems, EPUB was designed in the years before
  users had smartphones and tablets with full Web browsers. In those years,
  it made sense for users to carry low-capability devices that were
  specialized just for reading electronic books, and it made sense for there
  to be a format that targeted such users.

  <p>
  However, in the intervening years, EPUB and the general approach
  underlying it have increasingly faced criticism for not being at all a
  good match for current user needs; for one representative example, see
  the article
  ‚Äú<a href=http://toc.oreilly.com/2013/02/the-publishing-industry-has-a-problem-and-epub-is-not-the-solution.html>The publishing industry has a problem, and EPUB is not the solution</a>‚Äù[[EPUB]]
  from Jani Patokallio (who at the time he wrote the article was
  working for the publisher Lonely Planet, and now works for Google).

  <p>
  The shared understanding underlying those criticisms of EPUB and the
  general notion of any similar ‚Äúportable‚Äù document format is that
  since users have commonly had smartphones and tablets with full Web
  capabilities for years now, there is no longer any user requirement for
  specialized low-capability devices just to read electronic books, nor for
  legacy off-Web specialized reading systems‚Äîand so going forward into the
  future, there is no need for EPUB as a format, nor more generally for
  any EPUB-inspired
  ‚ÄúPortable Web Publication‚Äù
  format as envisioned in
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>.

  <p>
  Instead what we should do is to look at the actual current user needs
  without concern for any existing legacy formats, and to start back from
  first principles and design fresh solutions‚Äîwith the absolute highest
  priority given to user needs, over all other constituencies‚Äîand with the
  goal being purely to provide the best possible user experience of
  <a>books on the Web</a> and other <a>Web publications</a> to users today
  and for the future.

  <p>
  That is what this document does.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>
  This document outlines a vision for achieving the best possible user
  experience for readers of <a>books on the Web</a> and other
  <a>Web publications</a>, by looking at the problem from a fresh
  perspective‚Äîstarting from first principles.

  <p>
  So in this vision there is no need for ‚Äúconvergence‚Äù with other legacy
  off-Web approaches, nor any need to require users to ever ‚Äúswitch‚Äù back and
  forth between the Web and legacy off-Web reading systems, and no need for a
  new ‚Äúportable‚Äù document format, and in particular no need for an
  EPUB-inspired
  ‚Äú<a href=https://w3c.github.io/epubweb/>EPUB+WEB</a>‚Äù
  ‚ÄúPortable Web Publication‚Äù idea as envisioned in
  <a href=http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp/>Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a>.

  <p>
  Instead as outlined here we can use
  <a href=https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/>Service Workers</a>
  and the Web‚Äôs fundamental quality of
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/04/Japan/Lecture.html">universality</a>[[Universality]]
  as the foundation to provide users with a user-optimized seamless
  reading experience of <a>books on the Web</a> and other <a>Web
  publications</a> any time, anywhere, regardless of their reading
  context‚Äîspecifically, we can give users a 100% Web-based reading experience
  that
  <a href=#seamless>remains seamlessly consistent whether the users are online or offline</a>.

  <p>
  Just through the power of the Web itself, we can give users a truly
  <i>universal</i> reading experience.
